    <div class="depression"><strong>What is Depression?</strong><br>Depression is a heterogeneous disorder with a variable course, prevalent for the entire lifespan, with an unpredictable response to treatment.
      Depressed people show an increased avoidance behaviour and a decrease in the degree of positive reinforcements. Risk factors associated with depression are stressful life events, 
      hyperthyroidism, hypercortisolism, side effects of medications, genetic predisposition, and cancer. Certain metabolic disturbances, such as obesity 
      and diabetes have also been associated with depression. 
      <br>For a diagnosis of major depressive disorder (MDD), modifications in the mood (sadness or irritability) and associated psychophysiological changes (e.g. sleep disturbances, changes 
      in appetite or libido, anhedonia, etc.) need to be present for a period of at least two weeks. Further manic, hypomanic, or mixed episodes, are indicators of bipolar disorder. 
      MDD is different from persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia) in that the latter is a continuous, long-term form of depression, with less severe symptoms. MDD is excessively wide 
      and heterogeneous diagnosis, resulting in the same treatment in all patients meeting the diagnostic criteria for MDD, without the consideration of comorbidities and modifying conditions, 
      which may have different aetiology, and need different treatments. Therefore, a narrower definition of MDD and more accurate criteria for the use of drugs would be advisable.<br>
      <div class="buffer col-12"></div><br>
      <strong>Mixed Anxiety and Depression</strong><br>
      When anxiety and depression like symptoms co-occur, but neither of these are predominant and show subsyndromal symptoms of either clinical anxiety or depression, the diagnosis of mixed 
      anxiety and depression (MADD) should be considered. MADD patients are more resistant to treatments, show a greater suicidal rate, and often, show a more severe 
      psychological, physical, and social impairment, than both conditions alone. Although, about half of patients show an improvement within a year, there is a significant proportion of 
      those who develop the fully syndromic disorders. 
      <br>MADD has been proposed to be included in the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, fifth edition (DSM-5); however, due to the unreliability of the diagnostic 
      criteria, MADD was not included as a separate diagnostic category in DSM-5. Another possible reason of authors excluding MADD was that mixed symptoms of depression and anxiety were 
      considered as a depressive disorder with comorbid anxiety symptoms, despite MADD is easily distinguishable from major depressive disorder. Furthermore, former studies reported 
      significant differences between MADD and generalized anxiety disorder. The introduction of MADD as a separate diagnostic category in DSM-5 would allow early treatment of patients, 
      reducing distress and preventing the progression to a more serious psychiatric condition.<br>
      <div class="buffer col-12"></div><br>
      <strong>Depression and the Brain</strong><br>
      Neural systems affected in major depressive disorder (MDD) are emotion processing/regulating and reward-seeking networks. Consistent neuroimaging findings in MDD patients are 
      reduced metabolism in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, increased activity in the amygdala, insula, medial prefrontal cortex, and hyperactivity of the subcallosal cingulate cortex 
      (SCC). Volume reductions in the hippocampus, basal ganglia, SCC, and orbitofrontal cortex have also been identified as consistent characteristics of MDD. In addition, the regional 
      hippocampal volume is associated with poorer remission rates and treatment outcomes. Further considerations are resting and active metabolic rate of the insula, which may be a good 
      indicator of successful psychotherapy.<br>MDD patients show changed activity in the default mode network (DMN). This network consists of the medial prefrontal cortex, the posterior 
      cingulate cortex, the inferior parietal cortex, and the medial temporal lobe. Changes in the DMN are present at rest, but also in situations when patients are exposed to negative
      information. An increased connectivity between the SCC and DMN is apparent in refractory MDD.<br>Patients who respond to psychotherapy, and those who do not, tend to show characteristic 
      regional brain-states. Therefore, pre-treatment brain states identified by neuroimaging are significant in predicting treatment options and outcomes in the management of MDD. <br>
      <div class="buffer col-12"></div><br>
      <strong>Treatment Resistant Depression</strong><br>
      Treatment-resistant depression (TRD) is a type of major depressive disorder (MDD), that doesn’t respond to at least two different types of drugs, used at an accurate dosage and period.<br> 
      In the treatment of treatment-resistant depression (TRD), initially, antidepressants (mainly SSRIs) are selected while considering the patient`s history, the drug`s pharmacological 
      characteristics, as well as the experience of the physician. If the symptoms of depressions remit by the ‘decision day’, the treatment is maintained for six-to-twelve months. 
      When nonresponse to initial antidepressant drugs occurs, serum level measurements and genetic screening are recommended. Switching to another antidepressant drug is the most commonly 
      used strategy as a second step. Further strategies are augmentation of drug dose and the combination of reuptake inhibitors with presynaptic autoreceptor blockers. If depression shows 
      further resistance to treatments, monoamine oxidase inhibitors are suggested.<br>Psychotherapies have longer effect following cessation of the treatment, compared to pharmacotherapies.
       Cognitive behavioural therapy, for example, helps patients focusing on modifying negative cognitions. Whereas interpersonal psychotherapy is oriented towards problems in the patient`s 
       social and interpersonal relationships, psychodynamic psychotherapy and person-centred therapy (PCT) are based on the relationship between the therapist and the patient. Similarly, 
       cognitive behavioural analysis system of psychotherapy (CBASP) is a method specifically developed for the treatment of chronic depression, including behavioural, cognitive, and 
       interpersonal strategies. <br>Invasive- and non-invasive neuromodulation techniques offer further therapeutic options in the management of TRD. Electroconvulsive therapy is the most 
       effective non-invasive acute treatment for the major depressive disorder, with about 50-80% remission rate. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) was approved by the 
       Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2008, for the treatment of moderate treatment-resistant depression. <br>Invasive brain stimulation methods have been proved to be efficient in the 
       treatment of TRD. Vagus nerve stimulation was approved by the FDA for the treatment of TRD in 2005, for moderate resistance only, and with the need for regular check-ups by professionals.<br>
       Deep brain stimulation is the most invasive neuromodulator technique with side effects like infection, headache, and seizures. Neuroimaging studies showed changes in unspecific brain 
       regions. Therefore, its availability is limited to patients with extreme resistance level. <br>With an ever-increasing scale of treatment options offered in the management of 
       treatment-resistant depression, careful consideration of ethical aspects, such as voluntariness, risk and benefit information, and therapeutic misconception, is advisable; eventually, 
       it always depends on the patient which strategy will be chosen. <br>
       <div class="buffer col-12"></div><br>
       <strong>Inherited or Learned?</strong><br>
       The family history of depression is among the best predictors of the development of early childhood anxiety and depression. Studies revealed a genetic association between early 
       childhood anxiety and adolescent depression, especially in adolescent girls, suggesting that certain inherited neurobiological vulnerabilities may play a significant role in the 
       trajectory from anxiety to depression. Such vulnerabilities are social-evaluative threat and reward processing. During social-evaluative threat one`s self-identity is, or it is 
       believed to be negatively judged, leading to an elevated response (stronger than during physical threat) through the neuroendocrine system. Interpersonal threats, such as defeat, 
       humiliation, and rejection are specific characteristics of depression in youths, but often interpersonal stressors, such as break-ups, act as triggering elements of depression 
       . Furthermore, peer-rejection and lack of support from peers have a significant influence on the development of anxiety and depression in youths. Neuroimaging studies showed 
       hyperactivation of the amygdala in youths with MDD when exposed to situations where their emotions were judged. An increased activity of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in 
       adolescents was also found.<br> Brain regions responsible for the processing of social information and emotions become more sensitive during adolescence, which can be associated 
       with puberty and hormone (e.g. steroid) system activation. Changes, such as the lack of age-normative risky and sensation-seeking behaviour may result in a decreased positive affect
        and increased social withdrawal. Similarly, a repeated failure to social rewards, or the consistent omission of the reward may lead to the suppression of the reward system, eventually 
        resulting in anhedonia. In youths, the omission of social rewards leads to the suppression of the dopamine system, and, especially in anxious youths, this will result in fearful 
        avoidance, preventing them from seeking and attaining rewards. This eventually leads to stress, fear, and avoidance, resulting in anhedonia, and a possible trajectory to adolescent
         depression. Neuroimaging studies found decreased activity in the striatum, and increased activity in the mPFC in youths with high risk of depression. <br>
       Although current models suggest that depression is widely influenced by a combined interaction of genes, environmental experiences prior to adulthood, and certain neurobiological 
       elements, such as vulnerability factors, further understanding of the triggering elements and possible targets during early childhood development is necessary.
