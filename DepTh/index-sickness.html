    <div class="depression"><strong>Clinical depression and sickness behaviour: Are they the same?</strong><br>Sickness behaviour (SB) is characterized by behavioural and emotional changes, 
      such as discomfort, dejection, anhedonia, and decreased reproductive performance. Further physical symptoms, such as raised temperature, weight loss, and reduction in 
      locomotor activity are also associated with SB. The discovery of immunological changes during clinical depression and SB has a significant impact on the research area 
      dissecting the association between the immune system and the brain. Findings, such as that a prolonged activation of the immune system (e.g. chronic inflammation) may lead to depressive-like
       symptoms, and that certain types of cytokines show specific functions, are important in the differentiation of SB and clinical depression. <br>
      Cytokines, proteins involved in the immune response to infections, inflammation, and immunological alterations, act through cell membrane receptors. They are released from monocytes, 
      macrophages, lymphocytes on the periphery, and from astrocytes, microglia, and neurons found in the circumventricular region, hippocampus, hypothalamus, cerebellum, forebrain, brainstem 
      nuclei, and basal ganglia in the central nervous system (CNS). Cytokine family consists of the sub-groups interleukins (ILs), chemokines, tumour 
      necrosis factors (TNFs), interferons (IFNs), and transforming growth factors (TGFs). Cytokines can be grouped into pro-inflammatory cytokines 
      (IL-1, IL-2, IL6, IFN-γ, and TNFα), facilitating, and anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-4, IL-10, IL-11, IL13, and TGF-β), inhibiting inflammatory responses. Cytokines 
      have a significant effect on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. When the HPA axis is activated, cortisol is released from the adrenal cortex. Low cortisol 
      level results in an increased pro-inflammatory cytokine production, whereas an increased cortisol level (due to HPA activation) results in a decreased production of the pro-inflammatory 
      cytokines. Peripheral cytokine production is also regulated by the autonomic nervous system through direct parasympathetic regulation, or sympathetic noradrenergic 
      transmission. Cytokine release during peripheral stress also has a significant effect on the corticotrope releasing hormone (CRH) system, sympathetic nervous system, 
      promotes insulin resistance, and influences the coagulation system. Due to their molecular weight and hydrophilic characteristics, cytokines cannot pass through the blood-brain 
      barrier (BBB). Nonetheless, peripheral cytokines can transmit information to the central nervous system through passive diffusion through the circumventricular organ, 
      through active transporter mechanisms, or by nerve conduction pathways. Central cytokines have an important role in neuronal development, tissue 
      repair, synaptogenesis, and neuroplasticity. <br>
      Pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1, IL-6, and TNFα play a significant role in modulating the balance between the energy supply and the increased energy demand during pathogen threat, having a 
      significant effect in triggering SB. IL-1 has been described as an important activator of SB, and the administration of IL-1 antagonists have been shown to cause a 
      decrease in the cytokine-activated sickness behavioural phenotypes. Furthermore, the administration of IL-1β induces fever, HPA axis activation, and behavioural 
      changes, whereas the administration of IL-6 causes only fever and HPA axis activation, but not behavioural changes. Cytokine-induced SB is a fully reversible process, 
      and certain molecules, such as anti-inflammatory cytokines, glucocorticoids, prostaglandins, or insulin-like growth factors, downregulate the expression and action of cytokines in the brain. <br>
      Clinical depression is characterised by lethargy, loss of appetite, weight loss, fatigue, disturbed sleeping patterns, lack of concentration, and, similarly to SB, reduction in locomotor 
      activity. Disturbances of vegetative functions in depression (anorexia, psychomotor retardation, weight loss) are associated with an increase plasma haptoglobin level, 
      of which synthesis is induced by the IL-1, IL-6, and TNFα. Studies reported a close association between the imbalance of pro-inflammatory cytokines and depression. In a
       meta-analysis, Dowlati et al. (2010) reported findings from twenty-four studies, measuring the concentration of TNFα, IL-1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and IFN-γ in depressed subjects. Generally, a 
       significantly higher concentration of TNFα and IL-6 was found. Differences in the concentration of other cytokines in depressed and healthy subjects were not significant. Suarez and 
       colleagues (2003) demonstrated a significant association between the 21-item Beck Depression Inventory score and the level of monocyte-associated pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, 
       predicting an association between pro-inflammatory cytokine level and depression severity. Further studies highlight the importance 
       of co-morbidities of certain inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and coronary heart disease, with depression. <br>
      Certain molecular pathways have also been found to interfere with the complex behavioural phenotypes in depression and SB. Lowered plasma tryptophan level, for example, is strongly
       associated with biomarkers of inflammation in some depressed patients, highlighting the importance of the tryptophan catabolite (TRYCAT) pathway in the complex symptomology of clinical 
       depression. A rate-limiting step in the TRYCAT pathway is indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase, of which activation may separate SB from depression. Clinical 
       depression is associated with the activation of oxidative and nitrosative (O&NO) pathways and damages of proteins, lipids, DNA, and mitochondria. This may lead to IgM 
       mediated autoimmune responses, which has been found to be increased in depressed patients. The activation of this pathway in SB has not yet been reported. 
       Neurodegeneration, reduced neurogenesis, neuroplasticity, and apoptosis are further elements of neuroprogression that have been reported in depressed patients, but not in SB 
       . Memory, for example, was found to be decreased by 2%-3% following each recurrent episode in clinical depression. <br>
      Depression is an episodic disease with prolonged (chronic depression) and often recurrent episodes (recurrent depression), occasionally with the addition of hypomanic or manic components 
      (bipolar disorder), and seasonal variation. In contrast, SB is an acute, short-term behavioural response to an apparent infection or trauma, without the presence of 
      manic/hypomanic symptoms, progressive retrogression, or seasonal variance. Pyrexia has been found to be present in SB, although as reported by Szuba et al. (1997), 
      cited by Maes et al. (2012), some depressed patients can also be affected by an increased body temperature. Furthermore, suicidal ideations, guilt, and worthlessness are specific 
      characteristics of depression that cannot be found in SB. <br>
      Depression may also be considered as a behavioural response to a pathogen exposure, and its evolutionary appearance is for our body to avoid exposure to further pathogens. However, in this 
      case, depression should be a short-term, non-episodic body response, without the addition of manic or hypomanic components, suicidal thought and feelings of guilt and worthlessness. 
      As described by Maes et al. (2012) depression is not only a behavioural response but also a progressive disorder, with physiological changes in the nervous system. Accordingly, certain 
      changes, such as the accumulation of specific pro-inflammatory cytokines, or lowered tryptophan plasma level are specifically associated with this debilitating condition. Since these 
      symptoms may also be present in sickness behaviour, the consideration of their periodicity, seasonal appearance, or co-morbidity with other symptoms is important. Considering the importance 
      of differentiating clinical depression from SB, there is a need for the identification of specific markers and further measurable physiological changes, which allow the differential 
      diagnosis of these two conditions. <br>
