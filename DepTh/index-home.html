        <br>
        Anxiety and depression are some of the most common mental disorders associated with negative emotional experiences, affecting every country, culture, and ethnic groups (Juhasz et al., 2012). 
        Currently, there are two western-developed classification systems used for the diagnosis of mental disorders; The Diagnostic and Statistical manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) and 
        The International Classification of Diseases, 11th revision (ICD-11). Although both frameworks may strongly be biased towards European and North-American (western-based) cultural backgrounds of 
        mental illnesses, these have been accepted as a gold standard in the clinical practice. Despite the western-based construct of mental illnesses has been considered as universal, providing with 
        a standard care system for all, considerable differences have been reported among ethnic minorities (Choi, 2002). In order to understanding cross-cultural differences in mental illnesses, it is 
        important to understand what the concepts of culture and ethnicity mean, and how they interact with the development of emotions, moral values, self-concept, and child-rearing practice (Choi, 2002).
          Culture is defined as the collection of learned and shared values and normative led by a particular group, influencing one`s decisions, thinking, and actions (Choi, 2002).  Culture, furthermore, 
          presents standards and rules for demonstrating normality and abnormality (Choi, 2002). People and cultures actively interact with each other, changing and developing each other, manifested in a 
          process under continuous modification (Choi, 2002). Ethnicity refers to a group of people, who share common nationality, language, and/or culture, with a set of powerful information about their 
          values, beliefs, and behavioural rules (Choi, 2002). Ethnicity and culture are two indivisible concepts (Choi, 2002).  
        A particularly challenging task is to identify cultural effects in the development of emotions and behaviours in children and adolescents (Choi, 2002). Mohler (2001) describes two models, the 
        problem-suppression model and the adult distress model, which actively interact with each other, and a combination of the two models form child mental health outcomes and behaviours. Cultural-based 
        differences are due not only because of sociocultural differences, but also because of genetic differences derived from evolutionary and geographical isolation of ethnocultural groups (Juhasz et al, 2012). 
        <br>
        <i>Culture in anxiety and depression:</i><br>
        As highlighted by Juhasz et al. (2012), recent studies (Van de Velde et al., 2010) reported that differences in prevalence rate of depressive disorders as well as individual depressive symptoms could 
        be found even between culturally closely related European countries. Consistent cross-cultural and cross-country differences, such as somatisation of symptoms, guilt, expression of feelings, and 
        suicidal thoughts have been reported (Juhasz et al., 2012). Certain non-western cultures (e.g. Japan, China) show more somatic symptoms than western countries, where affective symptoms seem to be 
        more prevalent (Juhasz et al., 2012). This latter may be associated with social unacceptability of emotions and expressions of emotions in these cultures, which also leads to that eastern countries 
        reported less positive affects or expression of positive affects among people (Juhasz et al., 2012). This difference can also be explained by the collectivistic (eastern-countries) versus individualistic
          (western-countries) nature of the society (Juhasz et al., 2012). In a collectivistic culture, the individuals are highly interdependent, and the highest priority is the harmony within the group 
          (Hofmann et al, 2010). In an individualistic society, however, the most important thing is the progression and succession of the individual (Hofmann et al, 2010). In strict countries, such as Asia
          or South America, strict rules dictate the norms and expectations within the group or society. Individuals within the groups or society need to follow these rules, or sanctions, such as exclusion
            from the group, will be used (Hofmann et al, 2010). These social norms form result in an appropriate and positive behaviour of the individuals within the group, unless oneâ€™s cultural orientation 
            does not match with the cultural expectation of a society; this may lead to everyday stress and anxiety, eventually leading to the development or progression of SAD (Hofmann et al, 2010). Furthermore,
            SAD can develop from an excessive fear of violating social norms, that is embarrassing, which was found to be more significant in collectivistic cultures (Hofmann et al, 2010). Some countries, such 
            as the US promote individuals with an independent self-construal, meaning that these individuals consider themselves autonomous and self-motivated, separated from the social context, with the need 
            to be unique and distinguishable from other members of a society (Hofmann et al, 2010). In contrast, members of Asian society, for example, are more likely to show interdependent self-construal, 
            meaning that these individuals are considered as an integrated member of a society, dependent on other individuals (Hofmann et al, 2010). Living in an interdependent society, promotes self-awareness
              and resistance to evaluation by other individuals (Hofmann et al, 2010). Therefore, interdependence has a positive effect, whereas independence has a negative effect on embarrassment (Hofmann et al, 2010). 
              A significant variation in feelings of guilt among cultures has also been found; whereas eastern countries reported less frequent feelings of guilt in depressed people, western countries reported the a 
              frequently prominent feeling of guilt in depressive patients, which has also been associated with religious causes (Juhasz et al., 2012). 
        Stigmatisation may also have a significant influence on the prevalence of anxiety and depression across countries. Studies examining the social disruptiveness of anxiety and depression found that mental 
        illnesses or their mixture with somatoform disorders are more disruptive socially, than somatoform disorders on their own (Bagayogo et al, 2013). Furthermore, stigma concerns could also lead to an increase 
        of somatic symptoms (Bagayogo et al., 2013). The patients` illness model may also influence the presentation of the depressive symptoms; for example a predominantly somatic illness model will likely result 
        in a depressive disorder that is mainly manifested in somatic symptoms (Bagayogo et al., 2013). This provides with evidence that culturally defined illness models do influence symptoms presentations in 
        mental illnesses (Bagayogo et al., 2013). 
        The way we experience and express our emotions are influenced by racial, ethnic, and cultural factors (Hofmann and Hinton, 2014). The comparison of the prevalence of anxiety between different cultures is 
        challenging, due to the differences in language, political influences, geographic, and sociodemographic contexts (Hofmann and Hinton, 2014). Comparison of different cultures within a multicultural country 
        may overcome these challenges, such as presented in a study by Asnaani et al (2010), cited by Hofmann and Hinton (2014), conducted in a large sample of US population, for the assessment of the prevalence of 
        anxiety. In this study researchers found, that, for example, White Americans showed social anxiety-, generalized anxiety-, and panic disorders more frequently than other races, even following controlling for 
        demographic variables (Hofmann and Hinton, 2014). These findings can be due to the socio-political history of these ethnic groups, such as in the case of African Americans, who, according to Asnaani et al (2010), 
        met criteria for PTSD more frequently than other races, possibly due to a longstanding battle with racism (Hofmann and Hinton, 2014). When investigating a possible relationship between culture and anxiety disorders, 
        it is important to acknowledge the wide spectrum of factors, that may create an interactive relationship in different cultures. These factors may relate to ethnophysiology/ethnopsychology, or contextual factors 
        (Hofmann and Hinton, 2014). Ethnophysiology/ethnopsychology related anxiety symptoms are sourced from one`s ideas and understanding of their own bodily systems or symptoms, including pain, or poor concentration 
        (Hofmann and Hinton, 2014). In the case of contextual factors, on the other hand, the expression of the anxiety depends on social factors and norms (Hofmann and Hinton, 2014). 
        <br>
        <i>Western-based definitions and cultural contexts:</i>
        <br>
        Social anxiety disorder (SAD), for example, is an excessive fear of negative interpretation by others. Therefore, SAD is directly linked to culture dependent social standards and expectations (Hofmann et al, 2010). 
        One such example is the culture specific expression of SAD particularly prevalent in Korean and Japanese cultures, called Taijin kyofusho (TKS) (Hofmann et al, 2010). The expression of TKS is very similar to SAD in 
        the Western cultures, however, while patients with SAD from Western cultures are concerned in doing something that will embarrass themselves, TKS patients are concerned about doing something that will offend or 
        embarrass others (Hofmann et al, 2010). Consequently, TKS has been named as on offensive subtype of social anxiety disorders (Hofmann et al, 2010).
        Factors such as individualism, collectivism, social expectations/normative, and cultural consideration of gender role vary by culture (Hofmann et al, 2010). These factors may influence the development of an anxious 
        state and progression to anxiety disorder, therefore the examination of these factors, and the consideration of why and how these disorders are influenced by culture dependent qualities, is pivotal. 
        Self-construals are closely related to gender role and gender role identifications. According to Bem (1974), cited by Hofmann et al (2010), androgynous (those who with both masculine and feminine personality 
        characteristics) individuals, performed better on a wide-spectrum of tasks, whereas masculine or feminine type of individuals restricted their behaviour, according to the social norms of their gender. This 
        conflict may lead to an increased anxiety level, and formation of SAD.
        Whereas there is universal set of emotions across cultures, more complex emotions and feelings may vary between societies. These variation result in a difference in the experience and the expression of dysphoria 
        (Kirmayer, 2001).  Culture influences the forms of illness experience, source of anxiety, the way of understanding and dealing with symptoms of anxiety and distress, help-seeking, and the response of the society to 
        disease and disability (Kirmayer, 2001). Many countries consider mood disturbances as a social and moral problem, rather than individual mental health issues (Kirmayer, 2001). Such cultural ideas of emotions regulate 
        developmental experiences and coping strategies, influencing the course and severity of affective and anxiety disorders (Kirmayer, 2001). 
        Although there is an intensive exploration of cultural influences and cross-cultural differences in the development of anxiety and depression, our understanding of the reasons behind is limited. Certain hypothetical 
        explanations, such as ethnic influences in the vulnerability to anxiety and depression, exposures to traumatic events and stressors, such as cultural changes, have been suggested as possible triggering factors in the 
        development of mental illnesses. Furthermore, our understanding regarding biological variations across different cultural backgrounds or ethnic groups also contribute to the understanding of the linkage between culture 
        and psychological distress.  Considering culture, sex, and age should gain more attention during the definition and measurement of mental illnesses.
